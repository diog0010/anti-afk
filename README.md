# Anti-AFK
> "A wiggle a day keeps the AFK away!"

## Introduction
Tired of getting kicked from video games or having your status being set to away in Microsft Teams for being "AFK" (Away From Keyboard for the uninitiated) for merely _5 minutes_? Well I've got just the solution for you!

This trusty program will shake that mouse cursor around like no tomorrow, preventing that dastardly away status from ever showing its face again.

**Disclaimer: Use this program at your own risk.**
